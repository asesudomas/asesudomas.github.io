          Hello, my name is Domas. At this moment I'm studying Contemporary Communication
          in LCC International University and I decided to create a travelling website to share
          my thoughts about a country or place. I do understand that it may look like I'm still young and have no experience
          but in 19 years I have traveled to 14 countries. I am eager to pursue this hobby further until I have fully experienced
          what a beauty it is to live in this world. This time I chose Ukraine as my country to write about to which I went
          in summer and spent there 3 weeks. You will find out more about this journey while you continue reading the website.
        </h3>

          Ukraine is amazing and worth every second of attention.

  This is Chernivtsi University. One of the most beautiful places
  I visited in the city I fell in love with. It gave a sense of
  grandeur. While I was walking through the old Austrian architecture,
  I felt brought back a few hundred years back

      Carpathian mountains were the first big mountains I saw in my life.
      The dark green color of the woods brought a warm feeling and the landscape
      left me with the feeling of surprise.

      Witnessing history while travelling is something that makes me feel more alive.
      The final spot in my trip was a visit to Kyiv where I saw the centre of the city.
      It was magnificent to witness the heart of Ukraine and one of the biggest cities
      in Europe with my own eyes. While looking at the Independence Square which photo
      is shown on the left, I felt like I was experiencing together with Ukrainians the
      revolution and fight for freedom that happened there. These moments are the reason
      I have a desire to travel.
